# Experiments with the Two Stream radiative transfer model

## ESA Summer School 2016

### J GÃ³mez-Dans (National Centre for Earth Observation and University College London)


This repository contains some experiments on using the Two Stream radiative transfer model to invert land surface parameters. The experiments are written in Python (2.7), and use [IPython notebooks](https://ipython.org/), and  requires the installation of the `eoldas_ng` package, as well as the `gp_emulators` packages, as well as the standar Python scientific stack ([numpy](http://numpy.org), [scipy](http://scipy.org) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)). You can probably install most of this using the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
