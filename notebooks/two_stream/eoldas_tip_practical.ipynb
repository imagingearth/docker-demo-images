    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we consider the problem of extracting meaningful biophysical parameters from optical Earth Observation (EO) data. More concretely, we will use **bihemispherical broadband albedoes** as our input, interpret them through a simple **two-stream radiative transfer scheme** in order to retrieve a handful of parameters which are of interest in a large number of applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parameters related to leaf reflectance and transmittance in the visible and near-infrarred regions of the spectrum,\n",
    "2. Parameters describing the albedo of the soil under the vegetation,\n",
    "3. The *amount of vegetation*, expressed through an *effective* leaf area index (LAI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two stream model has been used both for parameter retrieval (as we shall do here), but has also been implemented in a number of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). This means that the parameters that are retrieved here will be strictly compatible with the same concepts in the DGVM, making them directly useable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we consider that the main role of the vegetation is in **flux partitioning**, or in other words,the amount of radiation that is absorbed by the canopy to be further used in photosynthesis, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Bits 'n' bobs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The input data\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of albedo products exist, such as the [GlobAlbedo product](http://globalbedo.org) or the [MODIS albedo product](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006/mcd43a2_albedo_product). In either of these cases, the products produce an estimate of the **bi-hemispherical reflectance** (BHR) (or *white sky albedo*) for a particular area at a particular time. The differences in these prodcuts are to do with whether data from one particular sensor was used, but are broadly comparable.\n",

    "We will use the \"two stream\" radiative transfer model of ([Pinty et al. (2007)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.131.4066&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (but also [Pinty et al, (2011)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010JD015372/full) and others). This is a fairly simple model that has been designed to monitor radiation fluxes in the land surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model has 7 parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leaf **single scattering albedo** in the VISIBLE\n",
    "2. Leaf **anysotropy** in the VISIBLE\n",

    "5. Leaf **anysotropy** in the NIR\n",
    "6. Background **soil albedo** in the NIR\n",
    "7. **Effective** leaf area index (**LAI**)\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are all that's necessary to describe the fluxes in a canopy. The price paide for this simplification is that the complexities of the 3D structure of the vegetation are dealt with by using an *effective* LAI. This LAI is different to the *true* LAI (with e.g. discontinuous crown clumping, etc.), but from the point of calculating fluxes like $fAPAR$, it is entirely equivalent, and simplifies things enormously.\n",

    "\n",
    "The use of spectral broadbands allows for a fairly simple description of leaf optical properties, which coupled with the amount of vegetation define the vegetation optical depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the vegetation is abundant, the effect of the soil will be negligible, as few photons will escape the canopy. However, if the soil is very bright (e.g. snow), this might be quite a significant amount. Also note that the vegetation optical depth is defined by the combination of leaf abundance as well as optical properties, so it is perfectly feasible to have the same albedos for two completely different canopies (e.g. one with low LAI and highly reflecting leaves, and one with darker leaves and high LAI). \n",

The TIP model will be $\\mathcal{H}$, and it predicts $\\alpha_{VIS}$ and $\\alpha_{NIR}$:\n",

Although such models *do exist*, maybe we don't want to *pollute* the data with model assumptions. So what could be a very simple model for e.g. $LAI_{eff}$ to use? Possibly the simplest model is to assume that the $LAI_{eff}$ doesn't change from day to day, but (critically), we assume that the **model is wrong**. In other words, we can write the model with its error as:\n",
